# Graphs-Plotter-in-c#
Creating a graph plotter GUI from scratch in c# language (windows forms), as a part of my final computer science work.

This version didn't developed with Regex's, so the input need to be entered with some rules (The regex's version will be uploaded soon):
- Need to enter the coefficient, even if its 1.
- If the coefficient is negative, need to enter + before. For example (4x+-3x^2).
- Doesn't work with Parenthesis except for trigonomtric functions and logarithmic functions.

* The regex's version with updated input methods (with no need of following those rules) will be uploaded soon.
